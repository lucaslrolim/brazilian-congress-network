## Software context

This software is the implementation of the analysis described in the paper [Homofilia e Assimetria na Rede de Coautoria de Proposições de Lei do Congresso Brasileiro](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/brasnam/article/view/6544) (Portuguese).

**Abstract:**

> The Chamber of Deputies is the maximum degree of people representativity in Brazil, having as one of its main goals the approval of law and projects to develop and manage the country. We have deputies from different regions, parties, sex, ethnicity, and education levels occupying the 513 existing chairs and creating alliances and negotiations to approve their projects in this heterogeneous environment. The goal of this work is to describe the coauthorship network among these deputies, concentrating in identify and characterize homophily and asymmetry patterns. We will propose and evaluate a new methodology to analyze the homophily in the congress network. Using the proposed methodology we will identify important aspects, as a high level of asymmetry and a lack of homophily among minorities.

## Functionalities

The software implements the following main functionalities:

- Methods to apply Social Network Analysis techniques (SNA), like homophily an asymmetry
- Original metrics  to measure homophily in weighted networks
- A pack of classes to extract data about coauthorship in the Brazilian Chamber of deputies from public sources
